BC GAY & LESBIAN ARCHIVES

The BC Gay & Lesbian Archives was founded in 1976 with the task of collecting, preserving items of British Columbia gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered and intersexual persons. Since it began, the collection has grown to over three-quarters of a million items, including a comprehensive HIV archive. 

Throughout this project, it became clear to us the importance of having such a record of our history. Without the passionate and tenacious work of archivist Ron Dutton, the AIDS Vancouver 30 30 Campaign would certainly not be the same.

The archives is located in the West End of Vancouver and materials can be examined by appointment by calling Ron Dutton at 604-669-5978 or by contacting rondutton@show.ca
